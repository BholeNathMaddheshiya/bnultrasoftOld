        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>Control Unit:</b></p>
        <p>This unit controls the operations of all parts of the computer but does not carry out any actual data processing operations. It communicates with Input/Output devices for transfer of data or results from storage.</p> <br>
        

        <p><b>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</b></p>
        <p>This unit consists of two subsections namely:</p>
          
          
         <p>Arithmetic Section</p> 
         <p>Logic Section</p> <br>
         <p><b>Arithmetic Section:</b></p>
         <p>Function of arithmetic section is to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. All complex operations are done by making repetitive use of the above operations.
        </p>
          
        <p><b>Logic Section</b></p>
        <p> Function of logic section is to perform logic operations such as comparing, selecting, matching, and merging of data.</p>  <br>

        <p><b>Memory Unit:</b></p> 
        <p>Memory Unit is the part where the computer stores  and retrives the data.</p>
        <p>There are two types of types of memory: </p>
         <p> 1. Primary Memory (RAM)</p>
         <p> 2. Secondary Memory (Hard Disk)</p>  <br>
         
        <img src="assets/img/introductionofcomputer/classification-of-memory.png" class="w3-round" alt="image" style="width:100%"></center> <br>

         <p><b>Primary or Main Memory :</b></p>
         <p>Primary memory is also known as the computer system's main memory that communicates directly within the CPU. Main memory is used to kept programs or data when the processor is active to use them. When a program or data is activated to execute, the processor first loads instructions or programs from secondary memory into main memory, and then the processor starts execution.</p> <br>
          <p>The primary memory is further divided into two parts:</p>
          <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) </p>
          <p>ROM (Read Only Memory)</p>  <br>

          <p><b>RAM (Random Access Memory):</b></p>
          <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is one of the faster types of main memory accessed directly by the CPU. It is volatile, which means if a power failure occurs or the computer is turned off, the information stored in RAM will be lost.</p>

          <p>There are two types of RAM: <br> <b> 1.  SRAM  &nbsp; 2.  DRAM </b></p> <br>


          <p> <b>SRAM: </b>SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) is a type of RAM used to store static data in the memory. It means to store data in SRAM remains active as long as the computer system has a power supply. However, data is lost in SRAM when power failures have occurred.</p>
          <p> <b>DRAM:</b> DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) is a type of RAM that is used for the dynamic storage of data in RAM. If the power is switched off, the data store in memory is lost.</p>  <br>

          <p><b>Read-Only Memory (ROM) :</b></p>
          <p>
            ROM is a memory device or storage medium that is used to permanently store information inside a chip. It is a read-only memory that can only read stored information, data or programs, but we cannot write or modify anything. A ROM contains some important instructions or program data that are required to start or boot a computer. It is a non-volatile memory; it means that the stored information cannot be lost even when the power is turned off or the system is shut down.</p> <br>
            <p>There are mainly three types of ROM: <br> <b> 1.  PROM  &nbsp; 2.  EPROM  &nbsp; 3. EEPROM</b></p> <br>
            <p> <b>1.PROM (programmable read-only memory):</b> </p>
          <p> PROM is a computer memory chip that can be programmed once after it is created. Once the PROM is programmed, the information written is permanent and cannot be erased or deleted.</p>  
        <p><b>2. EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory):</b></p>
        <p>It is the type of read only memory the data which stored can be erased and re-programmed only once in the EPROM memory. an EPROM can be reprogrammed if needed, first  we need to pass the ultraviolet light for 40 minutes to erase the data; after that, the data is re-created in EPROM.</p>

        <p><b>3. EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory):</b></p>
        <p>Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory can be erased and reprogrammed using an high voltage electrical charge. In EEPROM, the stored data can be erased and reprogrammed up to 10 thousand times. EEPROM was a replacement for PROM and EPROM chips and is used for later computer's BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)that were built after 1994. </p> <br>

              <p><b>Secondary Memory:</b></p>
              <p> Secondary memory is a permanent storage space to hold a large amount of data. Secondary memory cannot be accessed directly by the CPU, it means the data in the secondary memory is first loaded  into the RAM then which can operate  easily by the CPU. All the stored data  such as audio, video, pictures, text, software, etc in a secondary memory cannot be lost because it is a permanent storage area; even the power is turned off.</p>
            <p>Ex: - Solid-state drives (SSDs),
              Hard disk drives (HDDs),
              Cloud storage,
              CD-ROM drives,
              DVD drives,              
              Pendrives,
              SD cards etc</p>  <br>

              <p><b>Cache Memory:</b></p>
              <p> It is a small-sized chip-based computer memory that lies between the CPU and the main memory. It is a smaller and faster memory that stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory, it means the Cache Memory holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed.</p> <br>
              <img src="assets/img/introductionofcomputer/cache.png" class="w3-round" alt="image" style="width:100%"></center> <br> <br>

              <p><b>Register Memory:</b></p>
              <p>It is the smallest and fastest memory of a computer. It is a part of computer memory located in the CPU as the form of registers. The register memory is 16, 32 and 64 bits in size. These are the memory locations that are directly accessible by the processor.</p> <br>

              <p><b>Computer Memory Unit in Measurement:</b></p> <br> <br>
              <p>Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.</p> <br>
               <p><b>Bit: </b>The computer memory units start from bit. A bit is the smallest memory unit to measure data stored in main memory and storage devices. A bit can have only one binary value out of 0 and 1.</p>  
               <p> <b>Byte:</b> It is the fundamental unit to measure data. It contains 8 bits or is equal to 8 bits.</p> <br>

              <p>The first electronic computer used vacuum tubes as a serious piece of technology that was ENIAC, which stands for  Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, invented by J.W.Mauchy and J.P.Eckert.</p> <br>

              <p><b>Second generation (1956 - 1963) :</b></p>
              <p> Instead of vacuum tubes, the second generation of computers was supported transistors. From 1956 through 1963, transistors were widely utilized within the second generation of computers. </p> <br>

              <p><b>Third generation (1964 - 1971):</b></p>
              <p>The third generation of computers was supported Integrated circuits. In 1958-1959, Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce invented the IC (Integrated circuit), which was a signal component that could have a number of transistors.</p> <br>

              <p><b>Fourth generation (1972 - 2010):</b></p>
              <p>The Microprocessor, commonly called a CPU (Central Processing Unit), was used by the fourth generation of computers. A microprocessor is used in a computer that led to makes a computer more powerful and small in size as well as fits easily on a desk</p><br>
               
               <p><b>Fifth-generation (2010 to present):</b></p>
               <p>Fifth-generation computers may use neural networks and artificial intelligence and try to make decisions that mimic human beings. They can interpret information and make decisions. The ten million electronic components have consisted of the production of a microprocessor as this generation is based on Ultra Large-Scale Integration (ULSI). The Full form of VLSI is Very-large-scale integration.</p><br>

              <center><p><b><h3>Software:</h3></b></p></center> <br>
              <p>Software is a set of programs (sequence of instructions) that allows the users to perform a well-defined function or some specified task.</p>
               <p> The software is made up of binary language (composed of ones and zeros). Software programmers write the software program in various human-readable languages such as Java, Python, C#, etc.</p> <br>
               <p><b>Main types of software are:</b></p>
               <p>1. System Software</p>
               <p>2. Application Software</p> <br> <br>
               <p><b>System Software:</b></p> 
              
               <p> These software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware. It controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to work in. The OS is the best example of system software; it manages all the other computer programs.
              </p>

              <p>They are the first thing that gets loaded in the system's memory wherever you turn on your computer. System software is also known as "low-level software" because the end-users do not operate them.</p>

              <p> In System Software,  include the basic I/O (Input/Output) system procedures, the boot program, assembler, computer device driver, etc.</p>
              <br> <br>
              <p><b>The further classifications of system software are as follows:</b></p> <br>
              <p><b>1. Operating system:</b></p>
              <p>The operating system is the most prominent example of system software that acts as an interface between the user and system hardware. It is a group of software that handles the execution of programs and offers general services for the application that runs over the computer.</p>

               <p>Examples of Operating Systems are given below:</p>
               <p> <b>
