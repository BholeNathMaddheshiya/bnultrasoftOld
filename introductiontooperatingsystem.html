          <center> <h2><b> <u>What is an Operating System?</u></b></h2> </center>
            <p> An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between computer hardware components and the user. Every computer system must have at least one operating system to run other programs. Applications like Browsers, MS Office, Notepad Games, etc., need some environment to run and perform its tasks.
            
           In the Computer System (comprises of Hardware and software), Hardware can only understand machine code (in the form of 0 and 1) which doesn't make any sense to a naive user.

            We need a system which can act as an intermediary and manage all the processes and resources present in the system.
             It is responsible for the execution of all the processes, Resource Allocation, CPU management, File Management and many other tasks.</p> <br>
            
<img src="assets/img/introductionofos/os-definition-and-functions.png" class="w3-round" alt="Writer image" style="width: 100%;"> <br>  <br>

<p><b>There are three types of operating systems: −</b></p>
<p>1) Single-User/Single-Tasking operating system</p>
<p>2) Single-User/Multitasking operating system</p>
<p>3) Multi-User/Multitasking operating system</p> <br>

<p><b>Single-User/Single-Tasking OS</b></p>
<p>An operating system that allows a single user to perform only one task at a time is called a Single-User Single-Tasking Operating System. Functions like printing a document, downloading images, etc., can be performed only one at a time. Examples include MS-DOS, Palm OS, etc.
</p> <p>It provides command-line interface (CLI), a command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer.</p>
<p> <b>Advantages : </b>This operating system occupies less space in memory.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages : </b>It can perform only a single task at a time.</p> <br> <br>
<p><b>Single-User/Multitasking OS</b></p>
<p>An operating system that allows a single user to perform more than one task at a time is called Single-User Multitasking Operating System. Examples include Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OS.
</p> 
<p><b>Advantages : </b>It is time saving as it performs multiple tasks at a time yielding high productivity.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages : </b>This operating system is highly complex and occupies more space.</p> <br> <br>
<p><b>Multiuser/Multitasking OS</b></p>
<p>It is an operating system that permits several users to utilize the programs that are concurrently running on a single network server. The single network server is termed as "Terminal server". "Terminal client" is a software that supports user sessions. Examples include UNIX, MVS, etc.
</p> 

<p><b>Advantages :</b></p>
<p>It is highly productive as it performs multiple tasks at a time.
</p>
<p>It is time saving as we don’t have to make changes in many desktops, instead can make changes only to the server.
</p> 
<p><b>Disadvantages : </b></p>
<p>If the connection to the server is broken, user cannot perform any task on the client as it is connected to that server.
