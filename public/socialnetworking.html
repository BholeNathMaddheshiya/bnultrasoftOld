          <center> <h2><b> <u> What is Netiquette?</u></b></h2> </center> <br>
           <p>  Netiquette is a combination of the words network and etiquette and is defined as a set of rules for acceptable online behavior. Similarly, online ethics focuses on the acceptable use of online resources in an online social environment.
          </p><br> <br>

          <p><b>Some basic and important rules  Of Netiquette are:</b></p> <br>
          <p><b>1). Be Careful What You Type :</b> One of the core rules of netiquettes is thinking before typing. Depending on your audience, you should be mindful of your tone. So, before writing or using emojis, think twice. Moreover, proofread your emails and online content to avoid spelling and grammatical  errors. </p> <br>
          <p><b>2). Avoid Plagiarism (the act of copying another person’s ideas, words or work and pretending they are your own) : </b> One of the biggest perils of being in cyberspace is copyright infringement. Do not use another person’s words, images or information without permission and citing the source. Copy-pasting comes easy while working online, especially when you have access to so much information. Go one step further and credit the source. </p> <br>
          <p><b>3). Always Use Your Professional Email Address For Official Communication:</b> If you are working from home, send work emails using your official email address. If you do not have an official email, use a personal email that sounds professional. If your email has "cutegirl@gmail.com", "killerboy@gmail.com"  it leaves a bad impression in front of the email recipient. This is an important netiquette rule for professionals and also a netiquette rule for students looking for jobs and internships. </p> <br>
          <p><b>4). Think Twice Before Posting Pictures: </b> One of the basic rules of netiquettes says that you should avoid publishing or sharing unprofessional pictures. Posting unprofessional or inappropriate pictures (Voilence, Harassment, Suicide, Terrorism, adult images, False information, Hate speech etc), you should not post these kind of images because low age (below 18+) children also use internet.</p> <br>
        
          <p><b>5). Respect Others’ Privacy : </b> Another important netiquette rule for online etiquette is valuing other people’s privacy. Receiving confidential information comes with responsibility, you must never compromise your colleague’s or company’s privacy. Without permission, never make confidential information public in cyberspace. And only share information with people it concerns. This is a very important netiquette rule for students.</p> <br> <br>
