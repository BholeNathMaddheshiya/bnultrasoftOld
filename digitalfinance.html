<center> <h2><b> <u>Card [Credit / Debit] </u></b></h2> </center>
<br>
<p><b>What is a Debit Card?</b></p>
<p>A Debit card is issued by a bank against your current account or savings account. The major point to be noted about a debit card is that it allows you to use only the amount of money that’s available in your bank account at the moment. This implies that as you make payment using your debit card, the amount of purchase will directly be debited from your current or savings account.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>What is a Credit Card?</b></p>
<p>A Credit card is a financial tool that allows you to borrow funds from your credit card issuer at the luxury of making purchases as and when required. Additionally, to repay the borrowed amount, you get a grace period of around 45 days without any interest charges on the billed amount. When you buy a credit card, you get a customized credit limit, which indicates the maximum amount that you can spend using your credit card.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Similarities in a Debit Card and Credit Card :-</b></p>
<p>1) Both of these cards look identical and have a 16-digit card number.</p>
<p>2)A debit card and a credit card have expiration date.</p>
<p>3) In order to make a transaction, using either of these cards, you must enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) code.</p>
<p>4)Both, debit card and credit card can be used to make online and offline purchases.</p>
<p>5)Both these cards can be used at an ATM in order to withdraw money. </p>

          <center> <h4><b> What is e-Wallet?</b></h4></center>
           <br>
          <p>E-wallet stands for electronic wallet. It is a type of electronic card which is used for transactions made online through a computer or a smartphone. The utility of e-wallet is same as a credit or debit card. An e-wallet needs to be linked with the individual's bank account to make payments. The main objective of e-Wallet is to make paperless money transaction easier.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p><b>How does it work?</b></p>
           <p>E-wallet has mainly two components, software and information.</p>
           <p> Software component stores personal information and provides security and encryption of the data whereas information component is a database of details provided by the user which includes their name, shipping address, payment method, amount to be paid, credit or debit card details, etc.

          <p>The point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place at which a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment.</p>
           <p>After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is usually printed but can also be dispensed with or sent electronically.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <center> <h2><b> <u> INTERNET BANKING </u></b></h2> </center>
         
          <p> Internet banking, also known as online banking, e-banking or virtual banking, is an electronic payment system that enables customers of a bank or other financial institution to conduct a range of financial transactions through the financial institution's website.
          </p>
           <br>
           <p><b>Different types of online financial transactions are:</b></p>
           <br>
           <p><b>1) National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) :</b> National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) is a nation-wide payment system facilitating one-to-one funds transfer. Under this Scheme, individuals, firms and corporates can electronically transfer funds from any bank branch to any individual, firm or corporate having an account with any other bank branch in the country participating in the Scheme.</p>
           <p>However, such cash remittances will be restricted to a maximum of <b>Rs.50,000/-</b> per transaction. NEFT, thus, facilitates originators or remitters to initiate funds transfer transactions even without having a bank account. Presently, NEFT operates in hourly batches - <b>there are twelve settlements from 8 am to 7 pm on week days (Monday through Friday) and six settlements from 8 am to 1 pm on Saturdays.</b></p>
            <br>
      
            <p><b>2) Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) :</b>

              RTGS is defined as the continuous (real-time) settlement of funds transfers individually on an order by order basis (without netting). 'Real Time' means the processing of instructions at the time they are received rather than at some later time; 'Gross Settlement' means the settlement of funds transfer instructions occurs individually (on an instruction by instruction basis).</p> 
              <p>The RTGS system is primarily meant for large value transactions. The minimum amount to be remitted through RTGS is 2 lakh. The RTGS service for customer's transactions is available to banks from 9.00 hours to 16.30 hours on week days and from 9.00 hours to 14:00 hours on Saturdays for settlement at the RBI end. However, the timings that the banks follow may vary depending on the customer timings of the bank branches.</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>3) Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) :</b>

              IMPS offers an instant, 24X7, interbank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones.</p>
              <p><b>Objectives of IMPS:</b></p>
               <p>1)To enable bank customers to use mobile instruments as a channel for accessing their banks accounts and remit funds. </p> 
               <p>2)Making payment simpler just with the mobile number of the beneficiary. </p>
                <p>3) To sub-serve the goal of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in electronification of retail payments.</p>
                <p>4) 
                  To facilitate mobile payment systems already introduced in India with the Reserve Bank of India Mobile Payment Guidelines 2008 to be inter-operable across banks and mobile operators in a safe and secured manner.</p>
               <p>5) To build the foundation for a full range of mobile based Banking services. </p>
               <br>

               <center> <h4><b> What is  Online Bill Payment?</b></h4></center>
                 <p>Online bill pay is a digital banking or payment service that lets you pay bills over the web from a bank account—often at no extra cost.</p>
